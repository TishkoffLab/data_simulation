Scripts for simulating different scenarios of archaic introgression using msPrime. All simulations assumme a 30 year generation time for converting years to generations (Langergrabera et al, 2012 PNAS).

Two Modern Human Population Scenarios.
Both scripts simulate two modern human populations (AFR1 and AFR2) that diverge 150,000 years ago and an Archaic Altai Neanderthal poulation that diverges from the modern humans 765,000 years ago. All simulations have a constant population size for all groups of 10,000. ArchaicIntrogressoin depicts an archaic introgression pulse from the Altai Neanderthal to one Modern Human population, while the HumanIntrogression depicts an introgresion pulse from one modern human to the Altai Neanderthal. Both intogressions pulses occur 100,000 years ago. Each Simulation generates 30 modern human haplotypes per population sampled at time 0 and two Altai Neanderthal haplotypes sampled 50,000 years ago.

Four Modern Human Population Scenarios
Both scripts simulate 4 modern human populations (AFR1, AFR2, AFR3, AFR4). AFR1 diverges from all modern human populations 150,000 years ago, AFR2 then diverges from AFR3 and AFR4 at 125,000 years ago, and AFR3 diverges from AFR4 70,000 years ago. Each script simulates an Altai Neanderthal population that diverges from modern humans 765,000 years ago. All simulations have a constant population size for all groups of 10,000. HumanIntrogression includes a modern human to Altai Introgression pulse from AFR1 100,000 years ago. BothIntrogression adds a second introgression pulse from the Altai Neanderthal to AFR4 60,000 years ago. All introgression weights are 5%. Each Simulation generates 30 modern human haplotypes per population sampled at time 0 and two Altai Neanderthal haplotypes sampled 50,000 years ago.

Utilities
Scripts to edit vcf files.
remove_duplicate_positions.py	reads vcf file and removes variants with the same physical position.
